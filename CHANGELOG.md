### Added

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/rdkcentral/firebolt-cpp-transport/compare/v0.2.0...v1.0.0) (2026-01-13)

### Added
- Notice log level

### Changed
- **Breaking**: Configuration API for the Transport has been redesigned
- **Breaking**: The `invoke` and `request` methods are now asynchronous and no longer block waiting for responses

- **Breaking**: Function names now follow camelCase convention starting with lowercase letters
- **Breaking**: Event subscription string comparison is now case-sensitive
- **Breaking**: Removed dependency on Thunder
- Event payloads now require primitive values to be wrapped with a "value" key (e.g., `"params": { "value": VALUE }`)
- Set ExactVersion compatibility for dependencies

### Fixed
- Protection against incorrect payloads
- Protection for incorrect parameters in printf-style functions
- Client disconnect sequence
- Reconnection issue
- Race condition on simultaneous calls to Gateway::connect()
